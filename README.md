# CROL-List

CROL-List is a fast, dependency-free interface for searching and tracking **The City Record**—the official daily journal of the City of New York. Under NYC Charter §1066, municipal agencies must publish solicitations, awards, public hearings, regulations, and personnel changes here daily. 

This repository contains the complete system: a single-file static client (`index.html`) and a serverless Cloudflare Worker backend (`worker/`). It is designed to be easily forked and pointed at any city's open-data portal.

*   **Production App:** [crol-list.org](https://crol-list.org/)

## Key Features

### 1. Procurement Lenses
*   **💵 Money:** Follow contracts from RFP → Intent to Award → Award, complete with bidding deadlines, PASSPort links, agency contacts, and CSV exports.
*   **🔮 Predictive Forecasting:** Track upcoming solicitation opportunities 6 months before they are formally published. Fuses historical Checkbook NYC award durations to calculate expiration/renewal cycles, scrapes annual MOCS agency plans, displays a chronological vertical timeline widget on profiles, and triggers early-warning alert notifications.
*   **👤 People:** Explore city job listings, civil service exam statuses, pay scales, and appointment/payroll histories.
*   **🏗 Land:** Map rezonings in plain English, linked to the official City Planning ZAP registry and tax-lot (MapPLUTO) boundary polygons.
*   **🏛 Property:** Track municipal asset auctions (real estate, equipment, timber) and check building demolition statuses.
*   **📋 Rules & 🗓 Meetings:** Monitor regulatory changes, public comment windows, and public hearings.

### 2. Search & Alerts
*   **Subscription Quiz:** Build tailored watches via an onboarding wizard.
*   **Subscribe by Email:** Write to `subscribe@crol-list.org` in plain English; an LLM parses it into a watch and replies with a double-opt-in confirmation link.
*   **MCP for AI Assistants:** Point any MCP client at `api.crol-list.org/mcp` to search notices and create/preview watches programmatically ([docs](https://crol-list.org/api.html)).
*   **Proactive Alerts:** Receive morning email digests (queued per-subscriber delivery with independent retries) or subscribe to live RSS/Atom, JSON, and iCal feeds. Alerts deliver in English or Spanish based on your language preference.
*   **Spanish UI:** Switch the interface to Spanish via the header language selector; your preference is remembered. City Record notices remain in English (the official source language).
*   **[The Data](https://crol-list.org/data.html):** the City Record at a glance — sections, volume, procurement mix, top agencies/vendors by cleaned dollars — computed live in the browser.
*   **Unified Workspace:** Pin records, write local notes, export CSV/JSON dossiers, and generate shareable snapshot links.

## Architecture

*   **Frontend:** A single [index.html](index.html) built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS. Requests are executed directly from the browser to the open-data APIs.
*   **Backend:** A Cloudflare Worker ([worker/src/](worker/src/)) that manages email alert subscriptions (double opt-in), feed generation, public metrics, an MCP endpoint, inbound-email signup, and queued daily digest dispatches. One-time setup for email signup: an Email Routing route sending `subscribe@` to the Worker (Cloudflare dashboard → Email Routing → Routing rules). A D1 mirror of recent notices (refreshed daily from NYC Open Data, which remains the source of truth) backs alert matching and server-side search; each raw source row is stored alongside the parsed columns so upstream schema changes are recoverable.
*   **Performance:** Uses an in-memory query cache with request coalescing, skeleton placeholders, and lazy-loaded dependencies (e.g., Leaflet maps) to maximize load speed and visual stability.

## Testing & Development

[![CI](https://github.com/jimdc/crol-list/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jimdc/crol-list/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Both unit layers run automatically in CI on every pull request and push to `main`
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); the Playwright functional suite runs on manual dispatch.

Run tests from the repository root:

*   **Unit Tests:** Run `node --test` to verify entity stem compilers, name resolution, and date logic.
*   **Worker Tests:** Run `node --test` inside the `worker/` directory.
*   **Functional (Playwright) Tests:** Driven against a headless Chromium browser using:
    ```bash
    ./test/functional/run.sh
    ```
    *Requires Python 3 and Playwright (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`).*
*   **Production E2E Tests:** Run against the live production deployment using:
    ```bash
    CROL_BASE=https://crol-list.org/ ./test/functional/run.sh
    ```
