# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## i18n — the rules that keep Spanish (and the next nine languages) honest

- **Every page loads `i18n.js` and carries the shared header language switcher** (`#langSwitcher
  .lang-btn`) — index.html plus about/data/stats/api/changelog.html, since crol-subpages-es
  (2026-07-13). `crol_lang` in localStorage is one preference honored by every page on load
  (i18n.js's own bottom IIFE sets `window.LANG` *and* `document.documentElement.lang`/`dir`
  synchronously, before body paint, so there's no English flash).
- **Every user-facing string routes through `t()` / `tSection()`** (i18n.js) — including
  strings built in JS template literals and labels derived from DATA VALUES (City Record
  section names → `SECTION_I18N`). Two gates enforce it; run them before calling i18n work
  done: `python3 test/standards/stray_english.py` (source lint over all pages; its allowlist
  `test/standards/stray_english_allowlist.txt` may only shrink) and
  `python3 test/functional/13_stray_english.py` (hermetic rendered-DOM walk, every PR in CI;
  parameterized by `CROL_GUARD_LANGS` and, per page, `CROL_GUARD_PAGES` — default `index`;
  CI runs all six). Subpages get a lighter walk (load → switch → walk text) than index.html's
  full lens-driving one; approved translations are shared across pages automatically since
  `dict_fragments()` scans the whole `STRINGS[lang]` table.
- **Sharp edge — `t` shadowing:** never name a function parameter or local `t`
  (`pinBtn(t,…)` and `copyText(t,…)` both silently broke rendering, 2026-07-13 hotfixes).
- **Changing i18n.js requires a `?v=` hash bump** on EVERY page's script tag
  (`shasum -a 256 i18n.js | cut -c1-8`) — `test/standards/i18n_refs.py` checks all six pages
  and fails on any stale one (one shared file today, so all pages carry the same hash).
- **es orthography is gated:** `python3 test/standards/es_diacritics.py` fails accent-less
  forms of pinned Spanish words. Extend its map when a reviewer catches a new miss.
- **Language switching must repaint dynamic surfaces** — index.html's `rerenderForLang()`;
  subpages use the lighter `initSubpageLangSwitcher(onChange)` (i18n.js) — pass `onChange` when
  a page caches live-fetched data or a translated data-value (data.html's `renderSections()`
  re-runs `tSection()` from cached rows; stats.html's `paint()` re-renders the current async
  status instead of resetting to the loading string). **Wire the switcher synchronously**, not
  after an `await` — stats.html originally called `initSubpageLangSwitcher()` only inside the
  post-fetch branches, so clicking it during the loading window silently did nothing (caught in
  manual verification, 2026-07-13).
- **Interaction-gated states count:** the runtime guard seeds a pinned investigation item and
  walks `#investigation`; a new localStorage/hash-gated panel needs the guard walk extended
  or it will ship English silently (hotfix-2's lesson).
- **Content-zone carve-out for long-form/technical content:** `code`, `pre`, and `.chg-detail`
  are allowlisted content zones in `test/functional/assets/stray_english_allowlist.json`
  (technical/verbatim samples; changelog.html's per-release bullet lists and incident reports,
  which stay English behind a `chg_detail_note` disclaimer — an interim milestone, same posture
  as official notice content). Chrome, ledes, and every changelog release's reader-facing "For
  you" summary DO translate; only the archival technical detail is carved out.
- Notice CONTENT stays English (official source) with a per-language disclaimer; chrome and
  derived UI text always translate. en/es key parity enforced by `i18n_keys.py`.

## Test layers (what runs where)

- Every PR (CI "unit" + "a11y-pr" + "i18n-guard" jobs): standards gates, `node --test
  test/*.test.mjs`, worker tests, the axe + language + focus-visible + label-coverage +
  heading-uniqueness a11y gates (all against a plain local `http.server`, no live-API
  traffic — see Accessibility section below), and the hermetic stray-English guard across
  all six pages (fixtures in `test/functional/assets/i18n_fixtures.py` stub every
  upstream — no live network).
- Manual dispatch: full Playwright functional suite (`bash test/functional/run.sh`, live
  APIs). Serve on **port 8000** — the worker's CORS allowlist includes it; other local ports
  make live share/subscribe steps fail with "Couldn't reach the server". (When testing
  locally alongside another worktree/session, port 8000 may already be taken by someone
  else's server — pick a free port and pass `CROL_BASE=http://localhost:<port>/` instead of
  fighting over 8000, and never kill a process you didn't start without checking its cwd.)

## Accessibility — the gates that keep it wired

- **axe gate runs on every PR** (`a11y-pr` CI job, `test/functional/11_accessibility.py`),
  not just manual dispatch, and runs **hermetically** (wave 9: `i18n_fixtures.install_routes`,
  same fixture layer the stray-English guard uses — no live-API flakiness). It walks every
  `.tabbtn` tab (axe skips `display:none` nodes, so an inactive tab is invisible to it
  otherwise) PLUS the dynamic states no tab-activation alone reaches — digest preview,
  notice-detail (row click), entity-agency (permalink hash), the investigation workspace
  (localStorage-seeded) + its share-error path — **once in English, once in Spanish**
  (`LANGS` at the top of the file). `RATCHET_RULES` fails specific axe rule ids
  (`landmark-one-main`, `region`) regardless of impact level, so a fixed moderate finding
  stays guarded even though axe itself would only ever flag it as moderate. Local full run:
  ~30s for the entire en+es matrix.
- **Rendered-DOM census gates** (`test/standards/label_coverage.py`,
  `test/standards/heading_uniqueness.py`) also run in `a11y-pr` — they need Playwright +
  tab activation despite living under `test/standards/`, which is otherwise pure-text
  lints; they import `install_routes` from `test/functional/assets/i18n_fixtures.py` for
  the same hermetic fixture data the i18n guard uses (investigation workspace, digest
  preview, etc. all render without live network).
- **All six pages have a `<main id="main" tabindex="-1">`, a skip link (`.skip`, first
  focusable), and a `<footer>` landmark** for footer content — index got `<main>` in wave 7;
  subpages got the full set (they had none of the three) in wave 9, sharing index's `.skip`
  CSS and branded oxblood `:focus-visible` ring per page (no `?v=` machinery needed, it's
  per-page CSS). Don't reintroduce a bare content `<div>` outside `<main>`, and don't nest
  `<footer>` inside `<main>` — nested footer loses the `contentinfo` landmark role.
- **`test/standards/form_border_contrast.py`** (unit job) fails any `input`/`select`/
  `textarea` CSS rule bordering on `--rule` (1.58-1.81:1) instead of `--rule-strong`
  (3.56:1+) — the border is the only indicator of a text field's extent (1.4.11).
- **`test/functional/14_focus_visible.py`** is the focus-visible keyboard walk (NOT `13` —
  that number was already taken by `13_stray_english.py` by the time this card shipped;
  functional specs are numbered by file, not by wave, so check what's free before adding
  the next one). Static companion: `test/standards/outline_guard.py` (fails if
  `outline:none` ships without a `:focus-visible` replacement on the same selector).
- **`test/standards/attribution.py`** (pure text, unit job) asserts about.html cites all
  four open-data dataset IDs with links, per Local Law 11/2012.
- **`test/standards/link_text.py`** (pure text, unit job) is the NYC Web Content Style
  Guide descriptive-link-text lint — resolves `t("key")` calls used as link text against
  i18n.js's English dictionary before judging genericness ("click here" etc.).

## Architecture — static site + Worker backend

- The site (`index.html`, `i18n.js`, `test/`) is 100% static, deployed via GitHub Pages; the
  serverless backend lives entirely in `worker/` (Cloudflare Worker) — see `worker/README.md`
  for routes, secrets/vars, and the develop/test/deploy commands (`worker/` has its own
  `npm test`, independent of anything at repo root).
- The board-notification bridge (`worker/src/boardhook.mjs`, route `/board-hook`) auths
  App-first with a `GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN` fallback — see `worker/README.md`'s "Board-notification
  bridge auth" section. The `board-notify` GitHub App is live (app id 4288246, installed on
  cityscroll, installation id 146319774); its one-click creation kit stays outside this repo,
  in the maintainer's private tooling at `data/crol-appkit-h8/kit/` (`INSTALL.md` has the setup steps, for
  reference if the App ever needs recreating).

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
