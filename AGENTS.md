# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## i18n — the rules that keep Spanish (and the next nine languages) honest

- **Every page loads `i18n.js` and carries the shared header language switcher** (`#langSwitcher
  .lang-btn`) — index.html plus about/data/stats/api/changelog.html, since crol-subpages-es
  (2026-07-13). `crol_lang` in localStorage is one preference honored by every page on load
  (i18n.js's own bottom IIFE sets `window.LANG` *and* `document.documentElement.lang`/`dir`
  synchronously, before body paint, so there's no English flash).
- **Every user-facing string routes through `t()` / `tSection()`** (i18n.js) — including
  strings built in JS template literals and labels derived from DATA VALUES (City Record
  section names → `SECTION_I18N`). Two gates enforce it; run them before calling i18n work
  done: `python3 test/standards/stray_english.py` (source lint over all pages; its allowlist
  `test/standards/stray_english_allowlist.txt` may only shrink) and
  `python3 test/functional/13_stray_english.py` (hermetic rendered-DOM walk, every PR in CI;
  parameterized by `CROL_GUARD_LANGS` and, per page, `CROL_GUARD_PAGES` — default `index`;
  CI runs all six). Subpages get a lighter walk (load → switch → walk text) than index.html's
  full lens-driving one; approved translations are shared across pages automatically since
  `dict_fragments()` scans the whole `STRINGS[lang]` table.
- **Sharp edge — `t` shadowing:** never name a function parameter or local `t`
  (`pinBtn(t,…)` and `copyText(t,…)` both silently broke rendering, 2026-07-13 hotfixes).
- **Changing i18n.js requires a `?v=` hash bump** on EVERY page's script tag
  (`shasum -a 256 i18n.js | cut -c1-8`) — `test/standards/i18n_refs.py` checks all six pages
  and fails on any stale one (one shared file today, so all pages carry the same hash).
- **es orthography is gated:** `python3 test/standards/es_diacritics.py` fails accent-less
  forms of pinned Spanish words. Extend its map when a reviewer catches a new miss.
- **Language switching must repaint dynamic surfaces** — index.html's `rerenderForLang()`;
  subpages use the lighter `initSubpageLangSwitcher(onChange)` (i18n.js) — pass `onChange` when
  a page caches live-fetched data or a translated data-value (data.html's `renderSections()`
  re-runs `tSection()` from cached rows; stats.html's `paint()` re-renders the current async
  status instead of resetting to the loading string). **Wire the switcher synchronously**, not
  after an `await` — stats.html originally called `initSubpageLangSwitcher()` only inside the
  post-fetch branches, so clicking it during the loading window silently did nothing (caught in
  manual verification, 2026-07-13).
- **Interaction-gated states count:** the runtime guard seeds a pinned investigation item and
  walks `#investigation`; a new localStorage/hash-gated panel needs the guard walk extended
  or it will ship English silently (hotfix-2's lesson).
- **Content-zone carve-out for long-form/technical content:** `code`, `pre`, and `.chg-detail`
  are allowlisted content zones in `test/functional/assets/stray_english_allowlist.json`
  (technical/verbatim samples; changelog.html's per-release bullet lists and incident reports,
  which stay English behind a `chg_detail_note` disclaimer — an interim milestone, same posture
  as official notice content). Chrome, ledes, and every changelog release's reader-facing "For
  you" summary DO translate; only the archival technical detail is carved out.
- Notice CONTENT stays English (official source) with a per-language disclaimer; chrome and
  derived UI text always translate. en/es key parity enforced by `i18n_keys.py`.

## Test layers (what runs where)

- Every PR (CI "unit" + "a11y-pr" + "i18n-guard" jobs): standards gates, `node --test
  test/*.test.mjs`, worker tests, the axe + language + focus-visible + label-coverage +
  heading-uniqueness a11y gates (all against a plain local `http.server`, no live-API
  traffic — see Accessibility section below), and the hermetic stray-English guard across
  all six pages (fixtures in `test/functional/assets/i18n_fixtures.py` stub every
  upstream — no live network).
- Manual dispatch: full Playwright functional suite (`bash test/functional/run.sh`, live
  APIs). Serve on **port 8000** — the worker's CORS allowlist includes it; other local ports
  make live share/subscribe steps fail with "Couldn't reach the server". (When testing
  locally alongside another worktree/session, port 8000 may already be taken by someone
  else's server — pick a free port and pass `CROL_BASE=http://localhost:<port>/` instead of
  fighting over 8000, and never kill a process you didn't start without checking its cwd.)

## Accessibility — the gates that keep it wired

- **axe gate runs on every PR** (`a11y-pr` CI job, `test/functional/11_accessibility.py`),
  not just manual dispatch, and runs **hermetically** (wave 9: `i18n_fixtures.install_routes`,
  same fixture layer the stray-English guard uses — no live-API flakiness). It walks every
  `.tabbtn` tab (axe skips `display:none` nodes, so an inactive tab is invisible to it
  otherwise) PLUS the dynamic states no tab-activation alone reaches — digest preview,
  notice-detail (row click), entity-agency (permalink hash), the investigation workspace
  (localStorage-seeded) + its share-error path — **once in English, once in Spanish**
  (`LANGS` at the top of the file). `RATCHET_RULES` fails specific axe rule ids
  (`landmark-one-main`, `region`) regardless of impact level, so a fixed moderate finding
  stays guarded even though axe itself would only ever flag it as moderate. Local full run:
  ~30s for the entire en+es matrix.
- **Rendered-DOM census gates** (`test/standards/label_coverage.py`,
  `test/standards/heading_uniqueness.py`) also run in `a11y-pr` — they need Playwright +
  tab activation despite living under `test/standards/`, which is otherwise pure-text
  lints; they import `install_routes` from `test/functional/assets/i18n_fixtures.py` for
  the same hermetic fixture data the i18n guard uses (investigation workspace, digest
  preview, etc. all render without live network).
- **All six pages have a `<main id="main" tabindex="-1">`, a skip link (`.skip`, first
  focusable), and a `<footer>` landmark** for footer content — index got `<main>` in wave 7;
  subpages got the full set (they had none of the three) in wave 9, sharing index's `.skip`
  CSS and branded oxblood `:focus-visible` ring per page (no `?v=` machinery needed, it's
  per-page CSS). Don't reintroduce a bare content `<div>` outside `<main>`, and don't nest
  `<footer>` inside `<main>` — nested footer loses the `contentinfo` landmark role.
- **`test/standards/form_border_contrast.py`** (unit job) fails any `input`/`select`/
  `textarea` CSS rule bordering on `--rule` (1.58-1.81:1) instead of `--rule-strong`
  (3.56:1+) — the border is the only indicator of a text field's extent (1.4.11).
- **`test/functional/14_focus_visible.py`** is the focus-visible keyboard walk (NOT `13` —
  that number was already taken by `13_stray_english.py` by the time this card shipped;
  functional specs are numbered by file, not by wave, so check what's free before adding
  the next one). Static companion: `test/standards/outline_guard.py` (fails if
  `outline:none` ships without a `:focus-visible` replacement on the same selector).
- **`test/standards/attribution.py`** (pure text, unit job) asserts about.html cites all
  four open-data dataset IDs with links, per Local Law 11/2012.
- **`test/standards/link_text.py`** (pure text, unit job) is the NYC Web Content Style
  Guide descriptive-link-text lint — resolves `t("key")` calls used as link text against
  i18n.js's English dictionary before judging genericness ("click here" etc.).

## NYC Web Content Style Guide gates (wave 10)

- **Five unit-job gates**, all pure-text (some shell out to `node -e` to load `STRINGS.en`
  from i18n.js, same trick as `link_text.py`): `nyc_copy_lint.py` (banned acronyms, emoji,
  `<em>/<i>/<s>`, ampersand-as-and, and/or, semicolons, double-space, the specific-words
  table, inclusive-language deny-list, truncation abbreviations, PDF-link assert, currency
  shorthand outside chip context, 12-hour time forms, generic-text/case on `<button>`),
  `page_metadata.py` (meta description 120–160 chars, title <60 with the house `·`
  separator), `link_targets.py` (no `target="_blank"`, no decorative external-link `↗`
  icons), `heading_punctuation.py` (no colon/period in headings, `?` excepted), and
  `genai_disclosure.py` (about.html must carry the GenAI-content disclosure).
- **`nyc_copy_lint.py` ships report-only** (always exits 0, prints findings) — pass
  `--gate` to enforce; that flip is a separate task once the remaining prose findings
  (mostly `e.g.`, italics, and long-form `$NM` shorthand) are fixed. Its shrink-only
  allowlist (`nyc_copy_lint_allowlist.txt`) currently only tracks the chip/threshold
  currency exception (numerals-in-buttons is the guide's own carve-out).
- **House decisions, both deliberate deviations from the guide's literal text**: (1) the
  title separator stays `·` (already the brand mark everywhere else) rather than switching
  to the guide's hyphen — `page_metadata.py`'s docstring has the reasoning; (2) external
  links were made to CONFORM (not carve out) — same-tab, no `↗` icons, descriptive text
  instead, applied site-wide including inside i18n.js's `*_html` strings, not just the
  static markup.
- **`heading_punctuation.py` and the ampersand rule both carve out changelog.html's dated
  release `<h2>` titles** (`chg_*_h2` keys) — an archival register presented verbatim, same
  posture as `.chg-detail`'s English-only carve-out in the stray-English guard.
- **Cross-gate tension with the reading-level ratchet** (below): removing a link's `↗`
  icon replaces a bare glyph with real words (e.g. a bare `↗` anchor became "View in City
  Record"), which can nudge a whole page's Flesch-Kincaid grade by a hair even though
  nothing got harder to read — a mechanical side effect of satisfying one style-guide rule
  that another gate measures. If a future compliance edit trips the reading-level ratchet
  by a trivial amount for a reason like this, that's a known interaction, not a quality
  regression — say so in the PR rather than force-simplifying unrelated prose to compensate.

## Reading level — the readable-or-else ratchet gate

- **`reading-level` CI job** (every PR) runs [readable-or-else](https://github.com/jimdc/readable-or-else)
  (`pip install git+https://github.com/jimdc/readable-or-else.git` — not yet on PyPI) in
  `--mode ratchet` against the committed `reading-level-baseline.json`, `nycsg7` preset (NYC
  Web Content Style Guide, FK grade ≤7). Ratchet, not a hard gate: all six pages still measure
  above grade 7 (see the baseline file for current numbers) — it fails only on *regression*
  against the committed baseline, not on the pre-existing gap. Tighten the baseline (`ror
  baseline <page> --preset nycsg7 -o reading-level-baseline.json`) whenever a page's score
  improves; the command only ever lowers a recorded grade, so it can't be used to relax the gate
  — including by accident. **This means a sibling PR that site-wide find/replaces chrome text
  (e.g. wave 10's `&` → `and`, decorative-icon removal) can push an untouched page's *live* grade
  above its *committed* baseline without the tool offering any way to fix it** — `ror baseline`
  will silently refuse to write the new, higher, honest number back. When rebasing onto a main
  that moved, always re-run `check` against the full six-page set before opening/updating a PR;
  if anything shows `regression:` for a page you didn't touch, hand-edit that entry in
  `reading-level-baseline.json` to the freshly measured live grade (`measure()` from
  `readable_or_else.measure`, or trust `check`'s own reported number) and say so in the PR —
  this happened for `index.html` and `about.html` in crol-rerun-j6 (2026-07-13), both caused by
  a previously-merged sibling PR, not new content.
- **`fix` mode's file-mutation half round-trips the whole file through BeautifulSoup's
  `html.parser` and reserializes it** — this reorders/re-quotes every attribute on the page and,
  critically, **lowercases `viewBox` to `viewbox`**, silently breaking the inline SVG seal (SVG
  attribute names are case-sensitive; `viewbox` is not a valid attribute and the seal stops
  rendering with the intended dimensions). Never run `ror fix <page.html>` directly against a
  real page file. Instead: run it against a scratch copy to get real LLM rewrites + denial-rule
  verdicts (`--format json`), review each accepted rewrite for meaning drift, then hand-splice
  only the accepted candidate text back into the real file's matching leaf element (preserves
  exact original formatting elsewhere).
- **`fix` mode only rewrites leaf text elements with zero nested markup** (`p`/`li`/headings/etc.
  whose entire content is plain text — see the tool's own README "Fix mode" section). Any
  paragraph or list item containing an inline `<a>`, `<b>`, `<em>`, etc. is structurally skipped,
  not partially rewritten. In practice this means most of crol-list's hardest prose (the
  data-quality caveats in about.html, the sourced asides in data.html) is **not reachable by fix
  mode at all**, because nearly every long paragraph here carries an inline citation link — that
  prose needs a hand-authored pass (informed by `--suggest`'s whole-page rewrite, but re-spliced
  by a human) in a future wave, not another `fix` run.
- **FK grade is unreliable on very short leaf text** (a lone heading word like "Privacy" or
  "About" scores grade 8–20 on the formula despite being trivially readable) — `fix` correctly
  denies these (`grade_target` — the LLM can't legally shorten "Privacy" further), and that's
  expected, not a bug to chase.
- **Suggest-mode PR annotations are opt-in via a `suggest-rewrite` label** (not on the default
  per-PR run — it costs an LLM call per over-target passage). **`fix` mode's auto-apply-and-commit
  loop (the README's "maintenance loop in CI" recipe) is documented, not wired** — turning it on
  needs `READABLE_OR_ELSE_LLM_BASE` / `READABLE_OR_ELSE_LLM_KEY` / `READABLE_OR_ELSE_LLM_MODEL`
  repo secrets pointed at an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, none of which this repo has; add them
  and the `git-auto-commit-action` step from the tool's README before enabling it, and be aware
  of the BeautifulSoup-reserialization caveat above before pointing `fix` at real files in CI.

## Architecture — static site + Worker backend

- The site (`index.html`, `i18n.js`, `test/`) is 100% static, deployed via GitHub Pages; the
  serverless backend lives entirely in `worker/` (Cloudflare Worker) — see `worker/README.md`
  for routes, secrets/vars, and the develop/test/deploy commands (`worker/` has its own
  `npm test`, independent of anything at repo root).
- The board-notification bridge (`worker/src/boardhook.mjs`, route `/board-hook`) auths
  App-first with a `GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN` fallback — see `worker/README.md`'s "Board-notification
  bridge auth" section. The `board-notify` GitHub App is live (app id 4288246, installed on
  cityscroll, installation id 146319774); its one-click creation kit stays outside this repo,
  in the firstmate estate at `data/crol-appkit-h8/kit/` (`INSTALL.md` has the setup steps, for
  reference if the App ever needs recreating).
