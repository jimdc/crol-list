// i18n.js — CROL-List runtime string dictionary
// Architecture: plain-JS runtime dictionary, no build step. Loaded via <script src="i18n.js">
// in index.html. All LL30 languages are represented as stubs so the key structure is stable
// before new language translations are added.
//
// es: machine-translated, pending native review (Anna's CBO network, wave 6).
// fr-HT: Haitian Creole has no Intl locale; date/number formatting uses fr-HT.
// RTL note: Arabic (ar) and Urdu (ur) require dir="rtl" — scaffolded here as future work;
// use CSS logical properties in any NEW css (not retrofitted from existing physical properties).
// Bengali note: bn uses 2-2-3 digit grouping; Intl.NumberFormat('bn') handles this automatically.

// Supported language codes: BCP 47 locale, native label, layout direction, Intl date locale.
// Haitian Creole uses fr-HT for Intl (ht has no CLDR support).
