// nothing explaining the match in a lens list -- it "did not look education focused" even though
// the notice is squarely about an afterschool/childcare program in NYC public schools. The
// notice's own additional_description_1 column is blank; the explanatory text lives entirely in
// other_info_1, a column the app never fetched before this fix -- so even the already-working
// Alerts ask preview would have shown this notice as "matched via a field this preview doesn't
// fetch" instead of quoting the real text. Fixture data pulled 2026-07-15 from the live City
// Record dataset (dg92-zbpx) via
//   curl 'https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/dg92-zbpx.json?request_id=20260709010'
// and confirmed live against the exact Money-tab Award query (type_of_notice_description='Award'
// AND contract_amount >= 1000 AND contract_amount < 5000000000, $q=childcare) that this notice is
// a real, current result -- not a hypothetical.
