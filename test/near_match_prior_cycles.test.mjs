// Pins rankNearMatchCandidates() — the exploratory "maybe" tier below priorCycleAwards()'s own
// strict cross-PIN matcher (crol-list/w12-18).
//
// Before this fix: the strict matcher (rankPriorCycleCandidates(), see test/unit.test.mjs)
// requires a MAJORITY title-word overlap (score>=0.5) to avoid surfacing concurrent-RFP
// siblings as false "renewals" — but that same precision bar silently drops a real prior round
// that was simply retitled between cycles. A reader hit exactly this live: HPD's "IMMEDIATE
// EMERGENCY DEMOLITION OF 28 W 130th St, MANHATTAN (DM00121 E-6038R)" (2022) scores only 0.43
// against its real prior round "IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY DEMOLITION" (2019, same vendor Granite
// Environmental, PIN 80619E0021001) — 3 of 7 significant title words recur, just short of the
// strict bar — and the strict matcher's own live SODA query (a 6-word $q built from this
// notice's own title) returns exactly ONE row (itself), because "130th"/"manhattan"/"dm00121"
// are specific enough that nothing else on record matches all of them. Verified live against
// the SODA dataset (dg92-zbpx) before writing this fix, not assumed.
//
// Fixtures below are real award rows queried live from the City Record dataset, not invented —
// same sourcing discipline as test/cadence_estimate.test.mjs and test/past_winners.test.mjs.
// One test (marked below) uses a constructed PIN pair to exercise the PIN-prefix corroboration
// path directly, since no live pair combining a strong shared PIN prefix with NO usable amount
// signal was found within the research budget for this card — the test says so rather than
// mislabeling synthetic data as observed.
