"""Hermetic fixture dataset + Playwright network stubs for the stray-English guard.

Every upstream the client touches is intercepted here, so the guard (and any spec that
imports this) runs with NO live network: deterministic rows, deterministic counts, runs
in CI on every PR. The fixture numbers for the Today strip reproduce the 2026-07-13
captain report exactly (36 notices / 16 agencies; Procurement 26, Public Comment on
Contract Awards 8, Public Hearings and Meetings 1, Agency Rules 1).

DATA vs CHROME is the load-bearing distinction: values that come from these rows
(agency names, titles, vendors, methods, statuses…) legitimately stay English —
they are official-source data. `data_values()` exports exactly those strings so the
guard can allow them. section_name is deliberately NOT exported: section names are
rendered as navigation chrome (the Today strip, agency profiles) and MUST translate.
